# Google Cloud Print CUPS Connector
The Google Cloud Print (aka GCP) CUPS Connector shares CUPS printers with GCP.
It automatically adds, removes and updates GCP printers as CUPS printers change.

# Setup
For now, this connector only works with CUPS servers at localhost.

```
$ go get TODO/cups-connector
$ connector-init
$ connector
```
